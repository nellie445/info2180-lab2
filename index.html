        <p>I'm Jhanell, and my path to university was filled with difficult choices.</p>
            <p>Growing up in a disadvantaged town with limited opportunities, my parents worked tirelessly to make ends meet, and our local schools lacked resources. Despite these challenges, my determination to pursue higher education never wavered.
            Financial obstacles loomed large. Scholarships were scarce, and my family couldn't cover tuition and living expenses. I had to make tough choices, dedicating countless hours to searching for scholarships, writing persuasive essays, and securing financial aid. Through this persistence, I managed to win several scholarships.</p>
            
           <p> I faced academic hurdles due to my under-resourced high school. I taught myself advanced subjects and scoured online resources to excel in my studies, ultimately earning a spot at a prestigious university.  
            Personal doubts and the fear of leaving my community also tested me. Yet, with the unwavering support of my loved ones, I pushed through and made those hard choices, finally starting university and inspiring others to overcome their own obstacles along the way.</p>

        <h2> First Year at University</h2>

        <p>My first year at university was a whirlwind of new experiences and personal growth. Stepping onto the campus for the first time, I was filled with a mix of excitement and nervousness. It was a fresh start, a chance to explore my interests and chart my own path.

            One of the highlights of my first year was joining the performing arts club. I had always been passionate about theater and dance but had never had the opportunity to pursue them seriously before. When I saw a flyer for auditions, I knew I had to give it a shot. The nerves returned as I walked into the audition room, but the warm smiles of the club members and the encouraging atmosphere put me at ease.
            
            I ended up getting a part in the club's christmas production, and from that moment on, my life was a whirlwind of rehearsals, costume fittings, and late-night script readings. The camaraderie among the club members was incredible. We bonded over shared passions and the hard work that goes into putting on a show.
            
            Rehearsals were intense but incredibly rewarding. I learned so much about acting, stagecraft, and teamwork. It wasn't just about performing; it was about pushing my boundaries and discovering new talents within myself. The rush of being on stage, hearing the applause from the audience, and knowing that I was a part of something magical was unlike anything I had ever experienced.
            
            Outside of the club, my classes were challenging but stimulating. I met professors who were passionate about their subjects and classmates who inspired me with their ideas and perspectives. The university environment encouraged me to think critically, explore new interests, and embrace diversity.
            
            Of course, there were moments of homesickness and stress, but the support system I found within the performing arts club and among my new friends helped me navigate those challenges. As the year came to a close, I couldn't help but reflect on how far I had come. My first year at university had been a rollercoaster ride of growth, self-discovery, and unforgettable moments, and I couldn't wait to see what the next three years had in store for me.</p>
